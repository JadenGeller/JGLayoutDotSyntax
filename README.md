Introduction
=================

JGLayoutDotSyntax provides classes and categories to make it easier to add NSLayoutConstraints. Rather than entering lengthy code that specifies the views, attributes, relationship, constant, and mulplier all in a single function (not to mention the reciever view that must add the constraint), JGLayoutDotSyntax allows relationships to be specified simply and consicely.

Format
=================

Layout constraints can be specified simply and easily using reading dot syntax. The lenghty, hard-to-understand layout code
	[self.view addConstraint:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:subview attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:self attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX multiplier:1 constant:0]];
can be rewritten in a short, simple, easily understood format using JGLayoutDotSyntax:
	subview.centerX = self.view.centerX;

Conventional methods of creating autolayout constraints simply obfuscuate the intent, causing difficult to read and often buggy code. JGLayoutDotSyntax aims to fix that. The advantages achieved are even more stunning when you realize that each subview usually has about four NSLayoutConstraints created to define its location.
